I have been a quiet extrovert for majority of my life. I was a nerd, a jerk in school, not many friends, etc. Then I became a louder, more unapologetic version of myself in the last 6-7 years. I love talking, long conversations. I hate small talks (surprise, lol). I love celebrating things, even if it's the smallest of achievements.

I do not fear public speaking, which is why I have been hosting and organising events left and right in college and on the side, to help out a friend with his open mics. I also love going for photoshoots, hate being called a "model" but love being photographed, aesthetically.

I like going out with a lot of friends, usually the one dancing around the whole room and talking to literally everyone at a party. I like to travel and I would love to do it more often than I do now. I'm a people person. I get along easily, even though people say that I look unapproachable at first. (Taurus trait maybe!)

I have diplomatic and hypocritical opinions on social media, but I have 4 Instagram accounts. One private, one for my aesthetic urges, one for Web Dev, and another for my mental health care subscription box business, Escape.
