Around the same time that I started writing (10yo), I also began looking for inspiration by reading. My sister told me that our school library had these series called "[Sweet Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Valley_Twins)". I was in love with those stories. Then my mom took me to a nice vintage book store close to my school, where I found and fell in love with [Mary Kate and Ashley](https://www.biblio.com/mary-kate-and-ashley-olsen/author/29182). Along came Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew to trigger my dreams to be a detective even more.

Next came Harry Potter of course. I was 13 when I started reading, by which time I had already seen the movies a 100 times. The only book I read before watching the movie was Deathly Hallows. I tried reading more fantasy novels, but my bar was set really high, which made it impossible for me to love any other series as much as Harry Potter, until I came across Red Queen in 2018.

I read a lot of R.L Stein, Baby Sitter's Club, and other pre-teen fiction books in those years. Somewhere in between, I read Dan Brown and instantly knew I wanted to write a murder-mystery. Then at a book fair near my college, I discovered the most amazing: Nora Roberts, and my love for literature was renewed. Slowly, I went over to YA fiction, very select few John Green books, some under-rated YA fantasy fiction, Agatha Christie's crime fiction, some classic literature like Thomas hardy and Jane Austen, more mystery and a little bit of romance.

Currently, I do not read as widely as I would like to, but I still hog and collect new books every time I see a book store.
