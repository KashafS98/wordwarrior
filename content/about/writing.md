I started writing when I was 10. I had read a poem, ([The arrow and the song](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44624/the-arrow-and-the-song)) in my sister's poetry book. It touched my tiny little heart at the time. So much, so that I tried to write down something of my own. It was the birth of an emotional, hopeless romantic, who loved herself and the fact that she could write what ever she wanted.

I understood the power of words at a very young age and it was beautiful. I learnt to love the little things in life. The moon, the rain, the little kittens, clouds, drives, everything made me itch with a 1000 words waiting to be put down on paper
