I started writing when I was 10. I had read a poem, ([The arrow and the song](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44624/the-arrow-and-the-song)) in my sister's poetry book. It touched my tiny little heart at the time. So much, so that I tried to write down something of my own. It was the birth of an emotional, hopeless romantic, who loved herself and the fact that she could write what ever she wanted.

I understood the power of words at a very young age and it was beautiful. I learnt to love the little things in life. The moon, the rain, the little kittens, clouds, drives, everything made me itch with a 1000 words waiting to be put down on paper

I used to write short moral stories even as a child and poetries that tried so hard to explain the dilemna I was in, with my crush at the time. I started becoming famous at school for my short stories that included my friends and classmates as characters. I was part of the Shakespearean Committee at school, we were the editorial team for our school's year book. 

As I grew up, my poems became better, and then started deteriorating in creativity later. I still wrote articles and very short descriptive stories and published them on my blog. I was a part of WP blogging community where I made international friends, we formed a group blog and wrote on for a year too.

I started freelance writing on upwork at the age of 18, and continued for almost 2 years. I stopped when college got harder to cope with. To this day, I write articles, now on topics like mental health or pure aggressive rants, but my writing is scarce. I did re-start my murder mystery novel that I got an idea of during the last year of graduation. I have already started character development and plotting the book.
