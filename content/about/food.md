As much as I would enjoy a simple Dal Chawal, I am a pizza/pasta lover. I have phases where I either eat lots of pizza or I eat lots of pasta. Even with my migraine complications, I don't think I can ever stop eating cheese.

Apart from that, I LOVE donuts, pastries and anything that comes with frosting on top. I do not like ice-cream, which is quite often frowned upon (like my love for cats, and hate for dogs). I like to think I am authentically unique with my interests and I do not let those frowns change me.

I used to be a tea person, but it gave me high time anxiety during my last years of graduation and then I switched to Coffee, and of course, fell in love yet again. Starbucks' Triple Mocha, is my favourite, (of course i like my coffee with milk and loads of sugar). In fact, I'm not too hard to please. I'd take mocha from any cafe. I'd even take instant coffee(which is what I run on, on a day to day basis)
