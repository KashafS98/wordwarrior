I never traveled for pleasure as a kid. Not even with family. Only trips to Odisha and Gujarat to my parent's birth places. I went on treks and camps in school, and then in Grad years. My first long trip was my final year college trip to Uttarakhand. I saw Nainital, Haridwar, Rishikesh and Jim Corbett. 

After graduation, I started going on more treks and camps, I climbed Maharashtra's highest peak, Kalsubai, 5400ft, which was probably the best life-changing experience I had. Even through I was crying with tiredness on the trek down, it was one memorable achievement. After which, unfortunately, COVID-19 came up and the country was under lockdown. 

When the lockdown was opened, I took more trips, more frequently and finally started to quench my thirst for travel. I love doing adventure activities like Kayaking and I want to do more. On the checklist for now:

* zip lining
* river rafting
* Rapelling

I want to go on more long drives, long stays, treks and camps in my life. Traveling, I feel, is the best get away from our fast paced lives and is much needed for almost everyone.
