The first time I started having trouble was when after I turned 15. I had sad spells once a year at least. The frequency increased in just a couple of years. Around 17, I knew I had to see someone about it. I knew I had to talk more about it. I saw a psychiatrist, but it was no help. I shared with my sister and she told me to start reading self-help books, which also did not help. 3 years of graduation, a huge roller coaster in life. 

The process of becoming an adult in this ever-changing society, all the influence, the pressure, the "what will people think"s, all of it started getting almost too much for my anxiety. After I graduated, I knew I needed professional help and started therapy. It was a tough 2 years even after graduation. I was working, figuring myself out, in more than one way. 

All these experiences, made me an empath, a listener and a person who stands up for mental health awareness, advocates against the stigma. Learning and unlearning every single day, I am still actively seeking therapy and continuing to work on myself. Along with which, I have been more active than ever in raising awareness and talking about important things that people don't talk about. This includes feminist issues, body shaming, racism, and very importantly mental health and psychology.
