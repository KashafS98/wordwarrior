I was pre-schooled. I did my primary education in the ICSE board, up until Middle School (7th Grade). Moved on to State Board and passed my 10th Grade from the same. Both these schools were local schools.

I went to a college in the city, K.C. College, in Churchgate, traveled 2 hours hours each side every day. I selected Computer Science as my Junior College major, hoping to do B.E. I took classes to study for the entrance exams. Weirdly a child good at math started finding it hard. I went through some hard times mentally during the years which led me to drop the idea of Engineering and go for a simple Computer Science major for graduation. I started freelance writing during these years too, and created my own personal blog on WordPress.

Till date that has been my best decision. That and choosing a startup over those few glorified companies that come to hire from campuses every year. I learnt more doing BSc CS and working at a startup than I would have by doing engineering or going to a huge company. I slowly learnt that our society has glorified a few career paths so much that children fail to see the need of the changing times.

I learnt at my first job, first as a product manager, then while leading a product team, got a lot of experience at doing multiple jobs. I organised, did research, wrote articles, hired interns and started developing WordPress Sites. Later, in the same job, I switched roles when a new product idea blossomed. I became a Full Stack developer, learning and hustling. It was really hard the first 6 to 8 months, and then I finally started settling down. I became Front-end oriented very quickly, started leading the Front-end team. I had an amazing 2 years there, before it was time to move on to a new job.
